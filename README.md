Dataset info:
Metsis, Vangelis, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Georgios Paliouras. "Spam filtering with naive bayes-which naive bayes?." CEAS. Vol. 17. 2006.

Open the solution using Visual Studio 2017. Set the SEALExamples as the start-up project. The implementation uses Microsoft's SEAL library v3.2 found in https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL
For better communication and computation costs (performances), run the code in Release mode.
